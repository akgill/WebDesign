            <p align="JUSTIFY">Like the universe itself, the cosmology and astrophysics 
              program at Brown is expanding. Cosmology is the study of the origin, 
              evolution and fate of the universe. Astrophysics, on the other hand, 
              seeks to understand the physics of objects in the universe, such 
              as black holes, stars and galaxies. The exact division between cosmology 
              and astrophysics is nebulous and each relies on the other. In cosmology, 
              graduate students are engaged in research to understand the physics 
              of the very earliest universe and the evolution to its current state. 
              In astrophysics, graduate students are developing a detector to 
              measure the solar neutrino flux and spectrum. A healthy contact 
              between theorists, experimentalists and observers is maintained 
              through a weekly<br>

                    The different astro/cosmology groups are involved in a wide 
                    variety of research areas; a brief description of current 
                    research areas is given below.

                    Brandenberger's</a> theoretical cosmology group explores the 
                    tantalizing connections between fundamental physics and cosmological 
                    observations. Many observations such as the observed anisotropy 
                    of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the baryon-to-photon 
                    ratio, the spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic rays, and 
                    the origin of dark matter, can only be explained using physics 
                    which occurred in the very early universe. The energy densities 
                    at which this physics took place are much higher than can 
                    be reached in any terrestrial particle accelerator. The best 
                    testing ground for new theories of fundamental physics, such 
                    as string theory, is the early universe. 
                  <p align="JUSTIFY"> The theoretical cosmology group focuses 
                    on investigations of theories for the origin of structure 
                    in the Universe, and on developing specific predictions for 
                    CMB anisotropy and gravitational lensing maps. Other focal 
                    points are studies of the origin of the matter/antimatter 
                    asymmetry, and searches for observational signatures of new 
                    theories of fundamental physics, such as string theory.

                        study both the nature of the dark matter and the geometry

                        or the centers of clusters of galaxies, we seek to differentiate

                        using other tracers, such as the distribution and velocities 
                        of galaxies and X-ray luminous clusters of galaxies in 
                        the distant universe, to study the evolution of structure.</td>

        of the physics and events that occurred in the early universe. Measurements 
        of the CMB even provides clues to the state of the universe 10<sup>-35</sup> 
        seconds after the Big Bang, a regime not accessible by direct observation.

        making observations of the CMB from the ground and is involved in the 
        MAP satellite project. By looking at the very first galaxies to form in 
        the universe, which appear brightest at submillimeter wavelengths, we 
        will obtain a better understanding of how galaxies and structures of galaxies 
        formed. The group is developing a balloon-borne instrument called BLAST 
        to make these observations. Thesis students typically design and build 
        a special purpose instrument and then use the instrument to make observations.

              temperatures (~50 mK) provides a completely radioactivity-free and
