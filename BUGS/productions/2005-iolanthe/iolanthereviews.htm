      <p>Henry Kaplan, <em>The Brown Daily Herald</em>: &quot;Gilbert and Sullivan Society presents enjoyable version of lighthearted operetta 'Iolanthe' &quot; (<a href="#BDHreview">this page</a>) (<a href="http://www.browndailyherald.com/media/paper472/news/2005/11/18/ArtsCulture/Gilbert.And.Sullivan.Society.Presents.Enjoyable.Version.Of.Lighthearted.Operetta-1110357.shtml?norewrite&sourcedomain=www.browndailyherald.com">BDH website</a>) </p>
      <h2> <a name="MMreview"></a>Mercury Major: Great IOLANTHE at Brown University </h2>
      <p>        The Brown University Gilbert and Sullivan Society (BUGS), in its second staged production, has already reached a level of performance excellence equal to MITG&amp;SP or Harvard/Radcliffe. <br>
        <br>
        True, they lack money, so instead of a set, there was a large movie screen. During the overture a witty PowerPoint presentation showed the cast and their characters, and during each act it showed a nice backdrop- supplemented at appropriate times with useful (and funny!) information and commentary. <br>
        <br>
        The costumes were as traditional as funds allowed. Evidently those didn't run to capes and coronets, so the Peers were clad-surprisingly effectively-in dark suits with lace cravats and a crest on the pocket (a different crest for each peer). The fairies wore an eclectic assortment ranging in time from Ancient Greek and Egyptian through Hippie to funky contemporary-but all with wings. Again, it worked. Both male &amp; female choruses were outstanding, in both singing and acting! <br>
        <br>
        The Fairy Queen, Claire Coiro, had the best costume, a beautifully tailored long black dress with wide bell-like upper sleeves and multicolored lower sleeves and underskirt. She was tall and queenly, and though her waist was slender her presence was massive. Her singing voice was untrained, and therefore much quieter than her speaking voice, which was splendid. When she learns to sing with support and resonance, she will be a treasure to any Savoyard group! <br>
        <br>
        The only inadequate costume was Private Willis's; his tunic was the wrong type and looked unfinished, and his shako was just a cloth tube-but the actor, Jordan Elkind, compensated for it with his proud bearing and tall, soldierly figure. He did earn my wrath by changing the final notes of his "accept this friendship all the same" cadenza to a contemporary pop-music ending, TOTALLY unsuited to the harmony following in "this sacrifice to thy dear name." <br>
        <br>
        The lack of classical training was evident in many of the voices, but all were pleasant and tuneful. Iolanthe, Leila Chakravarty, had some trouble with "He loves".until the "withered flowers" climax, which soared into glory! Her "My doom" section was strong and good, too. <br>
        <br>
        Michelle Menard, the Phyllis, had a gorgeous professional-quality voice, and did a terrific long angry cadenza just before "Oh shameless one, tremble". She and Strephon were a delightful couple. He looked much like Sam Gamgee in the Lord of the Rings movies, in both costume and figure (though not hobbit-sized, of course). He was sometimes hoarse, but otherwise very good: his "chorused Nature" speech was especially excellent. The Lord Chancellor, Charles Shrader, was a very fine singer and actor too. The lead Fairies (Jessica Marquardt, Maggie Machaiek, and Lana Zaman) and Peers (Stephen Higa and Jackson Hoy Loper) were all energetic, engaging and funny. <br>
        <br>
        The music direction by Sam Baltimore was sprightly, though instruments and singers sometimes got out of sync, and the stage direction by Jonathan Ichikawa was excellent, with effective blocking and many imaginative touches. During "In vain to us you plead," the fairies magically stuck one shoe of each peer to the ground on the first "don't go"-which bothered me at first, because then why keep repeating it? But at "We'll go!" each peer escaped by slipping out of the stuck shoe and exiting oneshoed. The fairies then snatched up the abandoned shoes and clutched them lovingly. Sweet and funny! <br>
        <br>
        Strephon had a pet sheep which was a recurring prop. He addressed his soliloquies to it, sobbed into its fur at "Oh mother, weep with me," and used it to demonstrate to the lords how Iolanthe mothered him. At "your Strephon might have died," he turned it legsup, and put the "dead" sheep/baby Strephon into the arms of the Lord Chancellor, who wept over it. Then Lord Mountararat (Hoy Loper), in his "But as she's not" solo, took it from the Chancellor and tossed it over his shoulder back to Strephon. The combination of his supremely aristocratic contempt and the high arc of the flying sheep was indescribably funny. <br>
        <br>
        Another clever touch was that the fairies all had filmy scarves that rendered them invisible when pulled across their faces. Strephon had the same type of scarf over his wings. When Phyllis in Act 2 said "there's nothing to show it," he pulled the scarf off, and she suddenly saw his wings and reacted to them, opening and closing them and seeming utterly charmed. Just as I was by this performance. Well done, BUGS!  </p>
      <h2><a name="silverreview"></a>Peter and Linda Silverstein: </h2>
      <p>Hurrah for BUGS - Brown University Gilbert &amp; Sullivan- now celebrating its second season! It is wonderful that younger generations continue to "inherit" an appreciation for the works of G&amp;S and it is gratifying to witness a college student performer declaring that "All we want to do is bring G&amp;S to the people." <br>
          <br>
  We went to Providence to see the BUGS Fall production of IOLANTHE at the List Art Center on the Brown campus. Admission was free! It became apparent that the majority of the audience at this performance was composed of the families and friends of those involved in the show with a smattering of true G&amp;S fans. It was also clear that BUGS, by its own admission, is an organization in need of additional funding and support -- as evidenced by its small-lecture-hall venue with a non-moveable podium, white-boards, the lack of a legitimate set, and the orchestra crammed into a corner. But what the group lacked in cash, space, and materiel it made up for in ingenuity. No scenery? Not a problem. Simply project a PowerPoint presentation with slides of Arcadia and Parliament. This ploy was actually quite clever and was also used to explain the plot and the characters to a largely non-Savoyard audience. Act II, for example, began with a very cute explanation of the differences between peers and fairies. <br>
  <br>
  In short, BUGS shows great promise and should be headed for better stages. C'mon guys, you can charge for admission! BUGS will be producing PIRATES in the spring, and I encourage NEGASSers to head to Providence (where there are also lots of great restaurants) and check it out. </p>
      <h2><a name="BDHreview"></a>Henry Kaplan: Gilbert and Sullivan Society presents enjoyable version of lighthearted operetta 'Iolanthe'</h2>
      <p>This weekend, the Brown University Gilbert and Sullivan Society performs &quot;Iolanthe - or: The Peer and the Peri.&quot; The 1882 operetta tells the story of the fairy Iolanthe and her half-fairy son, Strephon, who with the help of the fairy community enters the British House of Peers. &quot;Iolanthe&quot; is the society's second full production since it was formed in Fall 2004.</p>
      <p>As a political satire, much of the play centers on the incompetence of the 19th-century British government, and the references may not be clear to modern American audiences. One of the play's strengths, as with most Gilbert and Sullivan musicals, is the music, even in this lesser-known work.</p>
      <p>An audience unfamiliar with opera might find &quot;Iolanthe&quot; more accessible than most operas. However, it will still not appeal to everyone. It has a strong sentimental streak, and the stuffy classicalness of Gilbert and Sullivan is offset somewhat by the offbeat production. But at over two hours, there is quite a lot of musical theater, which will surely be welcomed by fans.</p>
      <p>One of the play's strongest assets is its large and powerful orchestra, conducted by Samuel Baltimore '05. The musicians brought a subtlety and sense of fluidity to a score that could easily become overly baroque and choppy. Though occasionally overpowering the actors, the orchestra carried the production.</p>
      <p>The performances by the 24 cast members were uneven. Most of the performers possessed impressive singing voices, but many seem to have trouble transferring their singing into theatrical performances. Volume posed the biggest problem for most of the performers - without amplification, many voices became unintelligible.</p>
      <p>The principal actors were very strong. Claire Coiro '06, in particular, grabs attention in her performance as the Fairy Queen. She brought a dark and almost intimidating air to her role, singing with frightening forcefulness. Michael Ennis '08 was also impressive as Strephon, singing with a voice that rose above the orchestra in a way others did not. Michelle Menard '06 displayed an impressive operatic voice as the love interest, Phyllis.</p>
      <p>The production highlighted the play's lighthearted nature with offbeat touches - Strephon illustrated his job as a shepard by carrying a stuffed sheep. One fairy wore a tie-dyed shirt, and another was dressed as a pirate. Power Point presentations projected behind the actors occasionally provided recaps of the plot, in addition to backdrops.</p>
      <p>The limitations of List 120 did hinder the production. Actors were forced to enter and exit the stage by running up and down the aisle. More troubling, the room's acoustics were clearly not meant for musical productions.</p>
      <p>This production of &quot;Iolanthe&quot; presents a mostly faithful production of Gilbert and Sullivan's lighthearted comedy. While some performances were drowned out by the orchestra, others successfully played off of the strong musicianship and created some impressive moments.</p>
      <p>&quot;Iolanthe&quot; opens tonight in List 120 at 8 p.m. Performances are Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., with a Saturday matinee at 1 p.m. A gag version of the show will take place at 1 p.m. Sunday - a common event in Gilbert and Sullivan productions. The society's Web site warns that the gag show may not be suitable for children. Admission is free.<br>
